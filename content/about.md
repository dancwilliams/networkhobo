![Its Me!](/img/profile.jpg)

I have been in the networking field for around 15 years now. I have specialized in voice for most ofÂ this time but have also done quite a bit in the route/switch & data center arenas as well.

These days you will find me working diligently on various network automation projects and wondering around in the land of OT networking.

You can find me on LinkedIn by clicking [here](http://www.linkedin.com/in/danielcwilliams)!
