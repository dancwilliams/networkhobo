body: "Hello, Dan.\r\nThank you for the very clear post!  Quite helpful.\r\nI am interested in better understanding your Conclusion statement about using a VRF and then having the Tunnel pass routes into the global table.  Do you happen to have a known good config to share, or if not would you be so kind as to explain a bit more?\r\nThank you,\r\nDeb"
