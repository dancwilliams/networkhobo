body: "A few notes. On the hubs you have EIGRP config, on the spoke you have OSPF. The routing table shows EIGRP so you want to clean the config.\r\nYou can also collapse all 4 'ip nhrp map..' commands in only one using:\r\n\r\nip nhrp nhs <hub-tunnel> nbma <hub-nbma-ip | hub-fqdn> multicast (12.4(20)T)"
