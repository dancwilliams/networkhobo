body: "Does this method no longer work? I moved away from GoDaddy in early 2015 so I have not tested in some time.\r\n\r\nThe support documents look to be roughly the same, but with updated formatting. https://www.godaddy.com/help/add-an-ns-record-19212\r\n\r\nIf you tested and the method is no longer viable please let me know and I will add a note to the post citing your test.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
