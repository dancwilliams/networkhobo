body: "I have a very similar setup - but with 4 FireTV devices - 2 are FireTV and 2 are Sticks. I went through your directions and I still see some freezing, but it does seem better. The freezes are shorter in duration.\r\nOne question I have is does the Limiter need to be adjusted since I have 4 devices or is the Limit applied per device?\r\n\r\nThanks, Roy"
