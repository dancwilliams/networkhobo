body: "You are likely going to need a later version of `Hugo`.  I know there were some changes in templating in the `0.50` times that required some changes in the code.\r\n\r\nI am going on the assumption you are using Ubuntu...\r\n\r\nIt looks like Ubuntu doesnâ€™t have the latest in the [universe](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=hugo) repo.  [Here is a link](https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-hugo-on-ubuntu-18-04-lts/) showing how to install the latest (or other newer) version of Hugo on Ubuntu using the `deb` from the Github repo.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.  Let me know if you have any other questions, get it working, or run into a new error.  Thanks!"
