  the last Messages were about the Interfaces going down and ospf. from then on,
  i could not see the issu state of the standby. it never came back and the
  Primary was always in state "Load Version". after 30 minutes, i tried to
  Interrupt it by reloading the standby via console, but it never became "hot
  standby" again. any ideas how to fix this? if your experience is that the
  upgrade took you 1 hour then i just wasn't Patient enough ;)
