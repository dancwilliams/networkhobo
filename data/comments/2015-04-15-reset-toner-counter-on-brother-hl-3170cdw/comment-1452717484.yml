body: "FYI, firmware version 1.08 dated 15.05.26 seems to work. I can scroll through a variety of values. This is from a new printer installed today and getting familiar with the unit.\r\n\r\nAnd I agree, so far the printer seems okay for everything 8½—11, but still wishing I could find a reasonably priced and easy to maintain 11Ã—17 color laser. The only caveat so far is that it does pick up the pre-printed information from my checks."
