body: "I finally got this to work, thank you.  Problem was, on STEP 2, you did NOT make it clear whether we should continue to hold down the \"Secure\" and \"X Cancel\" buttons through STEP 3.  You just said \"hold\" them.  What does \"hold\" them mean--for HOW LONG???\r\n\r\nI finally figured out that we were NOT supposed to continue to hold them through Step 3, and it worked.\r\n\r\nThanks."
