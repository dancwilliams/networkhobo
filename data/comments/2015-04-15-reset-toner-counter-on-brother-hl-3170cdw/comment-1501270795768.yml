  Sometimes when I change the toner in the middle of a large printing job, the
  printer says: "ready" and the computer shows that the printer still has the
  print job.  But I can't get it to continue the print job.  To continue, I've
  been canceling the print job both on the printer and the computer, revising my
  mailing list and starting a new mail merge printing.  This is really tedious.
