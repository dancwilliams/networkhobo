  HL-3170CDW. I noticed that if there is a job pending, once I open the lid, I
  am unable to get the attention of the printer with the SECURE and CANCEL
  buttons. I must close the lid and hit CANCEL to kill the pending job. Once I
  confirm the CANCEL I can then open the lid and, following the steps outlined
  above, successfully reset the toner. It is worth mentioning that—at least on
  my printer/firmware version—I must choose from amongst three toner cartridge
  types, yields, to reset. I have high-yield cartridges but just selected STD
  for each of the four cartridges.
