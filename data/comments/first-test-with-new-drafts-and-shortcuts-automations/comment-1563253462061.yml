body: "One question.\r\n\r\nI have my website running on a separate server with nginx\r\nhttps://www.researchut.com\r\n\r\nMy intent is only to use github/staticman for the comments. So comments should get into the github repository and then I can choose to git pull them to my local repo, act on them, and then finally push to my actual personal git repository which serves the website.\r\n\r\nIs this a correct expectation to have with this setup?\r\nOr does staticman only work when hosting the website on github ?"
