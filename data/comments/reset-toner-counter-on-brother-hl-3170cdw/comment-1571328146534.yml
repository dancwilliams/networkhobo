  You are correct.  If there are jobs in the print queue, the toner reset steps
  don't work.  The simple way to clear the queue is like you did, turn off and
  back on.  Note if you're spooling from the computer, or a network device, it
  may help to unplug the USB or LAN cable while it's powered off.
