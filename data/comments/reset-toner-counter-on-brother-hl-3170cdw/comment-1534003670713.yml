  Thank you so much. My printer stopped working in the middle of a job and I
  have been trying to reset for at least 2 hours this morning. Like someone else
  said it did not work at first but don't give up. I ended up totally opening
  printed cover and pressing both button about 15 times repeatedly before I got
  the correct message. Just had to let you guys know it does work and don't give
  up.
