body: "Well hell, thanks for saving my sanity. I had replaced an HL-3170 CDW (bad board) and out of greed I kept the existing drums and toners. When the first one emptied I went ahead and picked up the unused (and still sealed) unit that shipped with the new printer. It kept insisting that the toner was empty, and this is an unused drum and toner set. Your reset procedure worked beautifully.  \r\n\r\nThanks so much for the tip!"
