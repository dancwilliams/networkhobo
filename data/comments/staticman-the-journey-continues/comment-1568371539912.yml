body: "Thanks. Yes, here is my site code. https://github.com/wini3d/minimaj \r\n\r\nIt seems there is a problem with replying_to not getting sorted out. I have checked some jekyll staticman v2 enabled blogs and I see the _parent is used for the _parent and _id sorting and it works. I then see the new staticman v3 used _parent for the url and not the parent id."
