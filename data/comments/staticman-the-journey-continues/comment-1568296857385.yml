body: "I currently do not have it up on Github, just here locally.  I am getting ready to get on a plane but I can try to get something cleaned and pushed up.\r\n\r\nAs far as Jekyll, I have not used it.  But, I know Minimal Mistakes was one of the pioneers in using Staticman with Replie,  [Check Here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#static-based-comments-via-staticman).  I used a lot of his logic when learning how to do Staticman in Hugo."
